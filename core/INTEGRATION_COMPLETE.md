## ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text Integrated Successfully

The chatbot now uses **ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API** instead of the Web Speech API for voice input.

### ✅ What Was Implemented

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Added ElevenLabs SDK to `requirements.txt`
   - Created `/api/transcribe` endpoint in `app_api.py`
   - Audio processing with base64 encoding
   - Error handling and validation

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Replaced Web Speech API with MediaRecorder
   - Audio recording from browser microphone
   - Base64 encoding for transmission
   - Live transcription display
   - Re-record and Submit controls

3. **UI Features**
   - Microphone button (pulses while recording)
   - "Transcribing..." indicator
   - Transcribed text display
   - Re-record and Submit buttons

### 🔑 Required Setup

**IMPORTANT**: You need to add your ElevenLabs API key to the `.env` file.

1. Get your API key from [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
2. Edit `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
3. Restart the Flask server:
   ```bash

   python app_api.py
   ```
